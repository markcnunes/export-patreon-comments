# Export Patreon Comments


Patreon loads about 10 or so comments on a post at a time. You have to manually refresh the load button to read the next round. It can take a long time if there is a high number of comments. 

Use this chrome extension on Patreon's posts pages to show all comments or export it as a CSV file.

How to use: Right-click on the page.

## Acknowledgments

This extension was developed over Discord from idea Gabrielle Motola had in sympathetic response to Amanda Palmer having to load 2000 patron's comments on a post and read them (which took 12 hours). Here is an article about Gabrielle's experience of her Patreon so far and how we collaborated to develop this.
